🚀 Future Enhancements for Dagster ETL Pipeline
The current Dagster ETL Pipeline processes static batch data from NYC Taxi and NOAA Weather datasets. Below are some key enhancements that can make this pipeline more scalable, real-time, and production-ready.

1️⃣ Use Real-Time Data APIs for Weather
🔹 Current Issue:
Right now, the pipeline processes static CSV files (weather.csv).
Weather data changes frequently, so using a real-time weather API would improve accuracy.
🔹 Enhancement: Integrate Real-Time Weather API
Instead of reading from a CSV file, fetch weather data in real-time from an API like:
NOAA API
OpenWeatherMap API
WeatherStack API
🔹 Implementation Steps
Replace table_2() asset in assets.py with an API call.
Use requests to fetch live weather data every hour.
Store the latest weather data in SQLite/PostgreSQL.
Modify joined_table() to use real-time data instead of static CSV.
🔹 Benefits
✔ Provides up-to-date weather data for analysis.
✔ Enables real-time analytics on trip data and weather impact.

2️⃣ Deploy on AWS Using Dagster Cloud
🔹 Current Issue:
The pipeline currently runs locally.
To scale, it should be deployed on a cloud platform.
🔹 Enhancement: Deploy Dagster to AWS
Use Dagster Cloud (Dagster Cloud Docs) for managed execution.
Deploy the pipeline on:
AWS Lambda (for serverless execution)
AWS EC2 (for full control)
AWS Fargate (containerized execution)
Store processed data in Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL) instead of SQLite.
🔹 Implementation Steps
1. Containerize the pipeline using Docker:
docker build -t dagster-pipeline .
docker push <your-docker-repo>/dagster-pipeline

2. Deploy to AWS:
aws ecs create-cluster --cluster-name dagster-pipeline-cluster
aws ecs run-task --cluster dagster-pipeline-cluster --task-definition dagster-pipeline-task

3.Use Dagster Cloud to monitor jobs remotely.
🔹 Benefits
✔ Scalable & Production-Ready
✔ Managed Dagster Jobs on AWS
✔ Easier Monitoring & Debugging

4️⃣ Store Data in PostgreSQL Instead of SQLite
🔹 Current Issue:
SQLite is not suitable for large-scale production.
SQLite does not support concurrent writes well.
🔹 Enhancement: Migrate to PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is a high-performance relational database that supports:
Multi-user concurrency
Faster query performance
Remote database connections

🔹 Benefits
✔ Scales to Millions of Records
✔ Faster Queries & Data Retrieval
✔ Can Be Deployed on AWS RDS for Remote Access



🔮 Future Scalability Ideas
🔹 1. Implement Real-Time Streaming with Kafka
Instead of batch processing, use Apache Kafka to stream taxi data in real-time.
🔹 2. Add Data Validation & Quality Checks
Use Great Expectations to ensure the data is clean before processing.
🔹 3. Deploy Machine Learning Models
Train ML models to predict taxi fares based on weather conditions.
🔹 4. Implement REST API for Data Access
Expose the cleaned data via a FastAPI service for external usage.
